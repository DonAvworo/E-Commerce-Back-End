This is the correct JSON for creating a product:

      "stock": 3,
      "tagIds": [1, 2, 3, 4]

    }

    This is the correct JSON for creating a user:
    {
      "username": "John",
      "password": "password"
    }

    {
      "review_text": "This is a great product",
      "rating": 5,
      "userId": 1,
      "productId": 1
    }
*/

models.Product.belongsToMany              // means that a product can have many tags and a tag can have many products
models.Tag.belongsToMany                  // means that a tag can have many products and a product can have many tags
models.User.hasMany                       // means that a user can have many reviews and a review can have one user
models.Review.belongsTo(models.User);     // means that a review can have one user and a user can have many reviews
models.Product.hasMany(models.Review);    // means that a product can have many reviews and a review can have one product
models.Review.belongsTo(models.Product);  // means that a review can have one product and a product can have many reviews
models.User.hasMany(models.Review);       // means that a user can have many reviews and a review can have one user

Miscipleneous notes:
==========================================================================
dot env file: 
-------------- 
stores sensitive information in a file that is not committed to the repo

  - the .env file hold connection credentials and any connection.js file will fail if not present. 
  - the .env file will just have name/value pairs
  - the .env is a good way to store sensitive information like passwords and keys
  - the .env file must be present for the app to run properly 
  - the .env file must be in the root of the project
  - the .env should must be in the .gitignore file
  - the .env file should not be committed to the repo

gitiignore file:
----------------
  - stores files that are not committed to the repo
  - the .gitignore file is a good way to exclude files from being committed to the repo
  - the .gitignore file must be in the root of the project
  - the .gitignore file should must be in the .gitignore file


json packages:
--------------
json files are used to store data in a format that is easy to read and edit
